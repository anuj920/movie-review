To Run this web App we require some library on system.
 1. Python 3.7
 2. Django 2.1.5
 3. Requests 2.21.0
 
 For python we have to download the python interpreter or any other software that provide python debugging.
 
 After  Python installation, We need the Django Framework on system.
  So for installation of django give commond on terminal:
  # pip install django OR
  # pip install django==version
  
 After Django installation we  need to Install Requests library,
  So for this , we have to give commond on terminal,
   # pip install requests OR
   # pip install requests==version
   
 After these above installtion we have to set the dierctory upto where the manage.py exist.
  and then give the commond on terminal
   # python manage.py runserver
   
  After run above commond we get a local host server url, copy that url and paste on any Browser and hit enter to run the Web App.
